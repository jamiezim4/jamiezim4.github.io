My current GH profile is <a href="https://github.com/jamiezim4?tab=repositories">@jamiezim4</a>

I lost access to my old profile <a href="https://github.com/jamiethezim?tab=repositories">@jamiethezim</a> (it was attached to my university email). 

It contains my school work among other personal projects. Anything important from it is now forked into my current profile.
