I"J<p>I climbed the south side of Mt Adams in 2019 with some friends for my birthday. I traced a map of the Mt Adams topography and imported into a vector drawing. I laser cut each major elevation line, then stacked them all. My plan is to drill a hole in the center and attach a motorized clock piece to make a tiny desk clock.</p>
