Hi there! My name is Jamie.

<img src="../images/me.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="400" >

I'm a software engineer by trade, a runner by hobby, and a human by nature.

I'm an Oregon transplant living in Burlington, Vermont, USA. Here you can find me working at my software engineering job at Cox Automotive, hiking with my pup, or taking a dip in Lake Champlain with friends.

While I love my life in New England, I am seeking career opportunities to bring me to Old England - London, to put roots down with my partner Miles and my dog River.

My interests are one mile wide and one inch deep. I welcome any conversation on the following topics:
<ul>
<li>My border collie pup, <a href="images/river.jpg">River</a> 🐶</li>
