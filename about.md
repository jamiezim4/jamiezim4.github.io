Hi there! My name is Jamie.

I'm a software engineer by trade, a runner by hobby, and a human by nature.

I'm an Oregon transplant living in Burlington, Vermont. Here you can find me working at my software engineering job at Cox Automotive, running with my dog on the bike path out to the causeway, or taking a dip in Lake Champlain with friends.

My interests are one mile wide and one inch deep. I welcome any conversation on the following topics:
